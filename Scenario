A renewable energy company operates several wind farms with multiple wind turbines. 
Each turbine generates performance data, including metrics like wind speed, power output, 
turbine rotation speed, and operational status. The company saves this data batches of 
CSV files and wants to process this data in batches to analyze performance trends, detect anomalies, 
and optimize maintenance schedules using reports developed in QuickSight of AWS or Tableau.A
