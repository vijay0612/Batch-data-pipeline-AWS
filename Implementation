Implementation:

1. Data Collection and Storage (S3 Bucket):
  1.Each wind turbine generates data, which is collected at regular intervals.
  2.This data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket in raw format (e.g., SV, JSON, or Parquet files). Each batch of data might represent a day's worth of metrics from all turbines in a farm.
2. Data Transformation and ETL (AWS Glue):
  1. ﻿﻿﻿AWS Glue is used to catalog the data stored in S3 and create a schema for easier querying.
  2. ﻿﻿﻿Glue jobs are configured to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on the raw data. These jobs might include:
    1. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing units of measurement.
    2.Data Transformation: Aggregating data to generate key metrics such as average wind speed per hour, total power output, and identifying periods of downtime.
    3. Data Loading: The processed data is then loaded into Amazon Redshift, a cloud-based data warehouse, for efficient querying and analysis.
3. Data Storage and Querying (Amazon Redshift):
  1. Amazon Redshift is used to store the processed data from Glue, where it is organized into tables.
  2.Redshift allows for fast querying and data aggregation, enabling the company to quickly analyze performance trends over time or compare data across different wind farms.
4. Data Visualization and Analysis (QuickSight or Tableau):
  1.The processed data in Redshift is connected to AWS QuickSight or Tableau for visualization.
  2. Dashboards are created to visualize key performance metrics, such as:
    1. ﻿﻿﻿Power Output Over Time: Visualizing how much energy is generated by each turbine or wind farm over different periods.
    2. ﻿﻿﻿Wind Speed vs. Power Output: Analyzing the relationship between wind speed and power generation efficiency.
    3. ﻿﻿﻿Maintenance Alerts: Highlighting periods when turbines underperformed or required maintenance based on historical data.
  3. Interactive features in QuickSight or Tableau allow users to drill down into specific turbines or time periods for more detailed analysis.
